            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>TO Anſwer Yours, without repeating, that the <hi>Prince,</hi> by his Circular Letters, hath recommended our Elections to all <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> cannot be looked upon as any Infringment or Diminution of our Liberties and Priviledges; Seeing that you know, that all our Liberties and Priviledges, whither by Cuſtome, or expreſs Acts, are given to the Burgh it ſelf, and only to its <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> in any Caſe, as Repreſenting the Burgh: But this hath be<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a great part of the unhappineſs of our late times, that what hath been allowed to the Magiſtrates, as repreſenting, and in behalf of the Burgh, they have aſſumed to themſelves, as their own Propertie, and thereby diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the Body of the <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> as their Maſters, rather then their Repreſentors: Now it being evident that it is the Priviledge of the <hi>Burgh</hi> to chuſe it's own <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> according to the Agreement called the <hi>Set,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to chuſe and ſend Commiſſioners to Conventions and Parliaments; And it being evident, that the <hi>Burgh</hi> hath for ſeveral years been deprived of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of chooſing their own <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> by having Perſons impoſed upon them by Court Letters, at pleaſure, and the preſent Set of Magiſtrates and Council, being ſtill (whatever may be pretended of a little Formality of Freedome in the laſt Election) of this <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Compoſition,</hi> what could be more juſt, than that ſince our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> to whom in the Ordinary courſe, the Electing for <hi>Conventions</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> hath been allowed in behalf of the <hi>Burgh,</hi> are not now our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> that is to ſay, of our pure and free Election, but the Courts, The Call we have got to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſhould be directed to the Body of <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> to whom the Priviledge of ſending to Conventions is principally given, and not to our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Council;</hi> ſince in effect they are not Ours, nor can be called our Repreſentors: And by this, you may alſo underſtand, that ſeeing they ly under this juſt Prejudice, as not to be allowed to Elect in the Ordinary Way, they can yet far leſs pretend that any of them ſhould be Elected, whatever the former uſe was. But the Truth is, Elections at all times ought to be free; and if any of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> pretend an Intereſt in them as a Property, it is an abuſe which now they ſhould be made to underſtand by a juſt diſappointment. And to enlarge a little this Reflection, is it not the bleſſing of the <hi>Prince's</hi> coming that we be relieved of former impoſings, and reſtored to our Liberties; and hath he not
<pb facs="tcp:150530:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 38 -->
already, for that end freed our Elections of all the Limitations of Oaths and Engagements, whereby formerly they were reſtrained; ſeeing then it is certain that it hath been by theſe Oaths and Engagements, that Good men hath been ſecluded from the <hi>Magiſtracie,</hi> and a Knot of Men got into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it for many years, who <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> too well known, whether in <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> have appropriated it to their own Caball, to the enriching of themſelves, and ruining of the Town; what can be more reaſonable and agreeable to the Mercy that God offers, then that wee ſhould lay aſide that whole Gang, and choiſe men uncorrupt and untainted with their Practices. And to proceed, ſince the <hi>Prince</hi> hath already ſet us upon the true Foot, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the reſtoring of our Liberties, and that now all Burgeſſes are equally called, as well as concerned in the Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is further evident that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever courſe the Magiſtrates, in Poſſeſſion, may lay down for keeping of Order in the manner of Electing, every <hi>Burgeſs</hi> hath an intereſt to inſpect it; And whatever Liſt the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> do make of <hi>Electors,</hi> and in whatſoever manner, every <hi>Burgeſs</hi> may be preſent to remark that he may object in due time; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe by bringing in of men that are no <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> for <hi>Electors,</hi> he may be deprived of all the benefit intended for him; But this is ſo plain from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf and the parity of the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning the <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Shires,</hi> whereby all the <hi>Electors</hi> are ordained to make, Reviſe, and alter their <hi>Liſts,</hi> that it were needleſs to inſiſt on it. And therefore all <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> ought undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly either to have free Acceſs to the obſerving of the making of the Liſts, or at leaſt, the Liſt ought to be timouſly publiſhed before the day of <hi>Elections</hi> that every man may know his <hi>Coelectors,</hi> and be in caſe to Object againſt ſuch as have no Intereſt to be there; <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd when both theſe are done, the <hi>Electors</hi> have ſtill a further priviledge of demanding a pole, wherein men are not to be barely numbred, but every one to be impartially queſtioned and examined by Perſons appointed by both ſides. By which things I hope ye may reſt well ſatisfied, that all the concern of the <hi>Neighbours</hi> that beſtirr themſelves in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to aſſert and reſtore the <hi>Liberties &amp; Priviledges of the Burgh,</hi> &amp; no ways either to Violate or Uſurp them. But men, who have found it their Intereſt in Times paſt to Inhance and Uſurp at Pleaſure may now cry out of <hi>Faction,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Prepoſſeſs the weaker ſort, as if theſe who intend to deliver the Town from their Dominion, were ſeeking it to themſelves: But let all honeſt Neighbours in the ſence of GOD<hi>'S</hi> Mercy, and the juſt Conſideration of their own Rights and Priviledges, Examine things as they are, and concure as they ought to do: Then both you and I may be moſt aſſured, that they will find nothing intended, but the good of the <hi>Burgh</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction of all honeſt Men.</p>
